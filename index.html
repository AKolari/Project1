        <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Andi Kolari. I am a student at the College of Staten Island. I am a part of Macaulay Honor's College. A prestigious 
            program for CUNY students which provides a full tuittion merit scholarship. I've been studying computer science for three years now.
            In my free time I like to play video games, watch movies and TV, ride my bike, and read. I am an aspiring computer science major at CSI 
            scheduled to graduate in spring 2024, but I think I could graduate in 2023 if I play my cards right. I hope that I can continue to grow as a CS
            student and soon as an an active member of the tech field. 
        </p>
        <h2>WHAT AM I DOING NOW?</h2>
        <p>
            Right now I am taking 6 classes at the College of Staten Island. I'm also working part time as a math, physics, and computer science tutor
            at the college's Office of Academic Support, and I am part of Cuny Tech Prep, a competitive program to help train CUNY students for tech roles in the future.
            I'm currently enrolled in the web-dev track at CTP. I'm also working on a project of my own, which is centered around social media, 
            and is a tool designed to help people spend less of their time on social media and doing the other things they enjoy about life. Below you can find my course curriculum, 
            and you can click <a href="/Project1/contact.html"><strong>HERE</strong></a> to check out some projects I have already worked on.

        </p>
        <h2>WHAT DO I WANT TO DO?</h2>
        <p>
           I am exploring a lot of different options for a career in the future. Right now I am doing a lot of work with web development, and I do enjoy
           what I have been doing so far. I've worked on some simple websites and webpages, and I hope to have some more complex pages under my belt soon.
           I have also done some simple Android App development. I have developed a few simple apps, and I am continuing to develop some of them in my free time,
           so app development is definitely something I am lookig at for the future. I have also made a game in Unity. I worked collaboratively with 2 other students 
           to create asimple top down video game as a final project for a game development class, and it was a realy enjoyable experience, so I've considered some kind of 
           game development work. I'm also looking into standard software engineering. I'm taking a software engineering class right now and I really enjoy what I have done 
           so far, so the prospect of turning that into a career is rather enticing.
