        The Book of Theseus
    </h1>
   <p>
    The Book of Theseus is a simple top down game created by me and two other students for an intro to video game development class at the College of Staten Island. The game was developed in Unity over the course of two months. By the end of the project, we had created a player character, multiple NPC's, and multiple levels. We also created art and animations for each of the NPC's and the player character. 
    We also had an in depth design document for our project, which documented all of our progress over the two months we worked on the project.

        Andi's Flashcard App
    </h1>
    <p>
        A simple flashcard app developed as part of my time in a CodePath intro to mobile application development course. The app was created in Android Studio, and utilized simple databases, animations, art, and user input. It allowed the user to create multiple flashcards in the app, and included a multiple choice quizzing feature, and a timer.

        Todd the Mental Health Bott
    </h1>
    <p>
        A simple C++ program developed early in my CS career with another student as part of a hackathon competition. Simple program which asked the user for some basic input, and would respond with one of many unique outputs based on the input given.

        Tiger Mum
    </h1>
   <p>
    An in progress project. First created as part of an entrepreneurial pitch competition with one other student. Initially just a business pitch, we have started to actually work on creating the android app, and we plan to expand and create a web application in the future as well. The app is designed to be a social media limiter, which will help people who spend too much of their time on social media by allowing them to funnel all their most imprtant social media content into a single interface so they don't waste time looking at supurflous content that only wastes time.
